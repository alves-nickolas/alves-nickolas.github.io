Counselor Deanna Troi: One cannot deny human nature. What kind of a man is Commander Riker?  
Lt. Commander Data: A fighter?  
Troi: Yes.  
Data: The weaker his position, the more aggressive will be his posture.  
T: And he won't give up.  
D: Then, despite whatever options he is given, he must be…
