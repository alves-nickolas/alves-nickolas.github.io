The topic with which I regularly conclude my six-term series of lectures in Munich is the partial differential equations of physics. We do not really deal with mathematical physics, but with _physical mathematics_; not with the mathematical formulation of physical facts, but with the physical motivation of mathematical methods. The oft-mentioned "prestabilized harmony" between what is mathematically interesting and what is physically important is met at each step and lends an esthetic — I should like to say metaphysical — attraction to our subject.
