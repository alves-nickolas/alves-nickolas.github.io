Before I explain the title and introduce the theme of the lecture I should like to state that my presentation will be more in the nature of a leisurely excursion than of an organized tour. It will not be my purpose to reach a specified destination at a scheduled time. Rather I should like to allow myself on many occasions the luxury of stopping and looking around. So much effort is being spent on streamlining mathematics and in rendering it more efficient, that a solitary transgression against the trend could perhaps be forgiven.
