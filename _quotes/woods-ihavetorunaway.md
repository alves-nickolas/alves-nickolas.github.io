I have to run away, I have to sit and stay  
I'm gonna live a life where I am proud to say  
That I followed my joy, I followed my heart  
I lived this one wild life, I ripped it apart  
I pushed through the corners, with no apologies  
And finally, I can say I know the way  
I'll say that I love the way that I spent my days!
