Many a fair young friend, oh Gravity,  
By smile and happy word  
Has made my heart beat faster,  
But with you my love affair  
Has never ended.  
You grow ever more beautiful  
With each passing decade.  
You lead the way  
To a new and higher lookout point,  
And behind yet another mystery  
You reveal hitherto hidden simplicity.
