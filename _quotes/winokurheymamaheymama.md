Hey mama hey mama
Look around
Everybody's groovin' to a brand new sound
Hey mama hey mama
Follow me
I know something's in you
That you wanna set free
So let go, go of the past now
Say hello to the love in your heart
Yes, I know that the world's spinning fast now
You gotta get yourself a brand new start

Hey mama, welcome to the 60's!
