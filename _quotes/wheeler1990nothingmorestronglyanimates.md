Nothing more strongly animates this book than a passionate belief that this is *our* universe, our museum of wonder and beauty, our cathedral. Marvelous are the seamounts and the geysers of the ocean floor. Dream-provoking are the buried cities of the past. Awe-inspiring are the continental drift that steadily tears Iceland apart and the fiery furnaces that we call stars. The pace of exploration grows swifter with each passing decade. We celebrate each new finding, each new glory, each new wonder. They are the rightful inheritance of every thinking human.
