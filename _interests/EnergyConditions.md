In general relativity, any spacetime geometry is possible, as long as one has the necessary type and distribution of matter. However, this means that some geometries require exotic kinds of matter that do not exist in reality. To avoid this, one typically imposes some conditions on the energetic behavior of matter to force it to be physical.

Unfortunately, quantum effects violate all of the classical energy conditions imposed on classical matter. However, some ideas reminisce. Recently, particular attention has been devoted to the so-called averaged null energy condition (ANEC) and quantum null energy condition (QNEC), which are quantized versions of one particular energy condition. These conditions are believed to hold in quantum field theory and, hence, they specify what sorts of matter are physical within the realm of quantum mechanics.

My interest in these topics is mainly concerned with using these conditions to generalize results from classical general relativity and further understand the interplay between matter and gravitational physics.
