“Renormalization group” is a fancy name we give to understanding how theories change with scale. Theories in larger scales don’t need to be treated with all of the details found in smaller scales. For example, when describing the motion of the ocean, it is usually unnecessary to consider the molecular structure of water. The renormalization group helps us to do this “zoom-out” procedure within the framework of quantum field theories. “Functional renormalization group,” in turn, is the name given to some nonperturbative incarnations of the renormalization group. It then consists of a technique to obtain information about a theory that goes beyond the typical approximations done in physics.

One interesting application of this tool is the asymptotic safety program in quantum gravity. Quantum general relativity is problematic at high energies because it is a non-renormalizable theory. However, it may be that this is an issue not with the theory itself, but rather with the perturbative approximation usually employed when studying it. The FRG allows one to study quantum gravity in a non-perturbative fashion, hence gathering information that otherwise would not be available. In the non-perturbative sense, a quantum field theory of gravity may be renormalizable after all.
