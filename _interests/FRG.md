>In preparation<< 

“Renormalization group” is a fancy name we give to understanding how theories change with scale. Theories in larger scales don’t need to be treated with all of the details found in smaller scales. For example, when describing the motion of the ocean, it is usually unnecessary to consider the molecular structure of water. The renormalization group helps us to do this “zoom-out” procedure within the framework of quantum field theories.

“Functional renormalization group” is the name given to some nonperturbative incarnations of the renormalization group. It then consists of a technique to obtain information about a theory that goes beyond the typical approximations done in physics.

My main interest in the FRG is concerned with its applications to QFTCS problems, although I am also curious about its applications to quantum gravity through the asymptotic safety program.
