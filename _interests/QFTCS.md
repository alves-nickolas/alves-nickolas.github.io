Understanding quantum gravity is difficult. However, a much easier problem is understanding how quantum fields behave in the presence of strong gravity. This led in the 1960s and 1970s to a framework known as quantum field theory in curved spacetime. In this framework, we make the simplifying assumption that gravity is approximately classical. This allows us to obtain a classical spacetime (often described by general relativity) upon which we can describe the behavior of quantum fields. While this is not a take on what gravity is fundamentally like, this framework has proven to be fruitful in understanding better the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity, hence giving us hints about what full quantum gravity should look like. 

One of the first predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime was Hawking's derivation of the so-called Hawking effect ([1974](#hawking1974), [1975](#hawking1974)). In general relativity, a black hole is _defined_ as the region of spacetime from which no signal can reach infinity (see, e.g., Wald [1984](#wald1984), Chap. 12). As a consequence, it is impossible for anything to come out of a black hole. It was thus a surprise when Hawking showed that black holes can emit particles due to quantum effects. Furthermore, the particle emission happens in a thermal spectrum, with temperature inversely proportional to the black hole's mass (in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole). Hence, in this sense, black holes can be understood as objects with a non-vanishing temperature once quantum effects are considered.
