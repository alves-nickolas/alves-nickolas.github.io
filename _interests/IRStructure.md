>>In preparation<<

While the ultraviolet behavior of quantum field theories was tamed by the renormalization program, the infrared structure was for a long time considered to be trivial and uninteresting. Nevertheless, it turns out this is not the case. One has very interesting behavior at the infrared limit. The three paradigmatic examples of interesting infrared phenomena are the following.

Firstly one has the so-called Bondi—Van der Burg—Metzner—Sachs (BMS) group, which is the symmetry group at null infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes. In principle, one would expect this group to be simply the Poincaré group (and hence the symmetries at infinity are just the symmetries of Minkowski spacetime), but actually one gets an infinite-dimensional lie group comprised of the Poincaré transformations and of the so-called supertranslations, which are direction-dependent translations. This means general relativity does not reduce to special relativity at very large distances, but rather to something much more complicated.

Secondly one has Weinberg’s soft graviton theorem. A soft particle is a particle with very small energy, small enough to not be measured by the detectors under consideration. Weinberg’s soft graviton theorem relates a scattering amplitude to the amplitude for the same scattering with the addition of a number of soft gravitons. This turns out to be a consequence of the BMS symmetries at null infinity.

Thirdly, one has the memory effect. This is the prediction that two nearby inertial detectors will be permanently displaced by the passage of a gravitational wave. The computations involved in the prediction of this effect can be matched to the soft graviton theorem, and the effect can be understood as a physical realization of a BMS translation.

My interest in these topics focuses on them per se, since I consider them to be interesting physics in their own, but also in their role understanding holographic structures in asymptotically flat spacetimes.
