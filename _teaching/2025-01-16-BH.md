title: "Introduction to Black Hole Physics"
date: 2025-01-16
abstract: "Black holes are some of the most fascinating objects in the universe. They are regions of spacetime in which gravity is so intense nothing can escape them. Since they constitute some of the most extreme scenarios of general relativity, it is curious that they can be described by only a few numbers such as mass, charge, and angular momentum. This high-school-level course discusses the basic ideas about black hole mechanics and how to make simple computations about complex objects. A few applications we will consider are how much energy can gravitational waves carry away in a black hole merger, how much charge can astrophysical black holes have, whether it is possible to turn a black hole into a naked singularity by overcharging or over-spinning it, how to extract energy from black holes, and much more."
