title: "Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime"
abstract: "This is an introduction to quantum field theory in curved spacetimes written for the minicourse presented at the Golden Wedding of Black Holes and Thermodynamics: An Online Celebration. It includes discussions about the algebraic approach, the Fock space approach, the path integral approach, and particle detectors suitable for someone with previous exposure to non-relativistic quantum mechanics and special relativity. Knowledge of general relativity and quantum field theory in flat spacetime is recommended, but not mandatory."
