# LaTeX Templates

Writing LaTeX is one of my hobbies. I don't like sharing all of my templates, because I grow quite attached to some of them. Nevertheless, some might make it to here. Notice the titles of the projects are hyperlinks to somewhere where the code is available. 

## [Research Journal](https://github.com/alves-nickolas/Research-Journal-Template)

For a while now I have kept a research journal to keep track of my progress in my MSc, which papers and books I checked, and so on. The idea is mainly to have a document with simple entries that can later help me when writing reports or when trying to remember a reference I checked months ago. Recently I've decided to update my template and make it available online. This is it.
