# LaTeX Templates

Writing LaTeX is one of my hobbies. I don't like sharing all of my templates, because I grow quite attached to some of them. Nevertheless, some might make it to here. Notice the titles of the projects are hyperlinks to somewhere where the code is available. 

## [Research Journal](https://github.com/alves-nickolas/Research-Journal-Template)

For a while now I have kept a research journal to keep track of my progress in my MSc, which papers and books I checked, and so on. The idea is mainly to have a document with simple entries that can later help me when writing reports or when trying to remember a reference I checked months ago. Recently I've decided to update my template and make it available online. This is it.

This template is also available in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/research-journal-template/hkbkxvmtzhzq).

## [Mood Tracker](https://github.com/alves-nickolas/Mood-Tracker-Template)

This is a simple model for a mood tracker calendar in LaTeX, originally created as an addition to my [Research Journal](https://github.com/alves-nickolas/Research-Journal-Template) template. It implements the calendar by using [pgfcalendar](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf) and defines new commands to allow for a simple user interface. Colors, legend, and date range are customizable.

I thank [Bet√¢nia C. T. Backes](https://github.com/b-backes) for the suggestion of allowing more than one mood on the same day. Hopefully future versions of this template will allow for more than two.
