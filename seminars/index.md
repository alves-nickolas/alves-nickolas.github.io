# Seminars

I've given many seminars throughout the years. This is a list of my favorites. They are accompanied by video recordings, lecture notes, and slideshows whenever possible. Seminars are chronologically ordered, with older entries at the bottom of the page.

## The Memory Effect and What It Means for Humankind

**Abstract:** The memory effect is a prediction in classical general relativity that consists of the fact that, upon the passage of a gravitational wave, a pair of nearby inertial detectors will be permanently displaced. In this seminar, I will review the basic ideas behind the linear memory effect and discuss how it is connected to other infrared aspects of general relativity, such as Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and the Bondi–Metzner–Sachs group. 

Short journal club–style seminar presented at my group's journal club and the [São Paulo Research Group meetings in Astro & Cosmo](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/astrocosmomeeting/). The slides (with commentary) are available [here](https://alves-nickolas.github.io/seminars/The_Memory_Effect_and_What_it_Means_for_Humankind__With_Notes.pdf). A video recording is available [here](https://youtu.be/JuVKy9LvGYA?si=Te_j8kn5nm0_uzHt) (the video starts in Portuguese, but it soon turns to English).

## Nonperturbative Renormalization Group Flow for a Particle Detector

**Abstract:** The functional renormalization group is a powerful tool to study nonperturbative physics, but it has not been much explored within quantum field theory in curved spacetime yet. On the other hand, particle detectors are an omnipresent tool within quantum field theory in curved spacetime and relativistic quantum information but are often treated only perturbatively. In this paper, we present the first computation of the functional renormalization group flow for a particle detector. The chosen model is an inertial Unruh–DeWitt detector in Minkowski spacetime, for simplicity. A new development in heat kernel techniques—the Taylor trick—is necessary to perform the calculations and it is important to carefully choose cutoffs that diverge at the ultraviolet limit to keep the beta functions finite. We compare our results with the MS-bar results at one-loop and find that both computations agree qualitatively, as expected.

Based on [arXiv: 2305.17453 [gr-qc]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17453) and work to appear.
