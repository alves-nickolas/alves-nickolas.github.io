<p>I have presented many seminars throughout the years. This is a list of my favorites. They are accompanied by video recordings, lecture notes,  slideshows, etc whenever possible. Seminars are chronologically ordered, with older entries at the bottom of the page.</p>

{% assign listofseminars = site.seminars | sort: 'date' | reverse %}
{% for seminar in listofseminars %}
