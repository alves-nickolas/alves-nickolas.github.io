abstract: 'This is an introduction to quantum field theory in curved spacetimes written for the minicourse presented at the <a href="https://bht50.github.io/" target="_blank">Golden Wedding of Black Holes and Thermodynamics: An Online Celebration</a>. It includes discussions about the algebraic approach, the Fock space approach, the path integral approach, and particle detectors suitable for someone with previous exposure to non-relativistic quantum mechanics and special relativity. Knowledge of general relativity and quantum field theory in flat spacetime is recommended, but not mandatory. The content follows closely, and sometimes overlaps with, the author’s master’s thesis, <a href="https://alves-nickolas.github.io/abs/2305.17453/">2305.17453</a>'
