<p>This page lists different minicourses I taught throughout the years. Lecture notes and video recordings are given if they are publicly available. As usual, occurrences in Portuguese have documents in Portuguese.</p>

{% assign courses = site.teaching | sort: 'date' %}
{% for course in site.teaching %}
    <h2>{{ course.title }}</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">{{ course.event }}</p>
    <p>{{ course.abstract }}</p>
    <p>{{ course.lecturenotes }}</p>
    {{ course.videorecordings }}
    <br>
{% endfor %}
