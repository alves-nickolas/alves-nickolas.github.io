<!--<p>In Brazil, it is common for undergraduate students to take on a "scientific initiation" project. In theoretical and mathematical physics, this is usually a project ranging from six months to a few years consisting of reviewing a specific topic within an area of interest. I carried out my project on hyperbolic equations of mathematical physics, aiming at being prepared to later start a master's degree on quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</p>-->
