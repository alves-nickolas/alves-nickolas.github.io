# Et cetera

This is the rest. Things I wanted to keep on this website but didn't really fit in other tabs. Here you can find some quotations I like, links to websites I like, et cetera.

## Quotations

My [old website](http://fma.if.usp.br/~nickolas/) already had a space for quotations in its Et cetera tab, but none of them had any sources. This time I'm gonna try to be more rigorous with these references, despite liking many quotations that are probably apocryphal. They are ordered according to the author's last name, year, and title. For quotes from movies or TV series, I order them according to the actor's last name.

	<li>Therefore, conclusions based on the renormalization group arguments concerning the behavior of the theory summed to all orders are dangerous and must be viewed with due caution.<br>

	<li>The set of transformations (50.22)–(50.24) is called the renormalization group. Rarely has there been a more pretentious name in the history of physics. It’s like calling classical dynamics “the study of the Hamiltonian group of time translations”. Nevertheless, that’s what it’s called.</li>

	<li>The topic with which I regularly conclude my six-term series of lectures in Munich is the partial differential equations of physics. We do not really deal with mathematical physics, but with <em>physical mathematics</em>; not with the mathematical formulation of physical facts, but with the physical motivation of mathematical methods. The oft-mentioned "prestabilized harmony" between what is mathematically interesting and what is physically important is met at each step and lends an esthetic — I should like to say metaphysical — attraction to our subject.</li>

	<li>[S]emiclassically, an initial pure state will evolve to a mixed state.

## Star Trek Quotations

I started watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455/" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em></a> a while ago and I've been taking notes of way too many quotes to keep them alongside the other ones. All of the following come from ST:TNG and I organize them by season and episode, instead of following the alphabetical patterns of the previous section. 

<div style="text-align: justify">
   <ul>
	<li>Things are only impossible until they're not!</li>
	<p>Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708841/" target="_blank">S01E16: "When the Bough Breaks"</a>.</p>
	<li>There is still much to do. Still so much to learn.</li>
	<p>Captain Jean-Luc Picard. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708811/" target="_blank">S01E25: "The Neutral Zone"</a>.</p>
	<li>Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the beginning of wisdom is "I do not know". I do not know what that is, sir.</li>
	<p>Lt. Commander Data. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708843/" target="_blank">S02E02: "Where Silence Has Lease"</a>.</p>

## Questionable Quotations

Who am I fooling? Apocryphal quotations can be fun as well. Just be aware that I have no clue whether any of these were actually said. 


<div style="text-align: justify">
   <ul>
	<li>Les papillons sont le seule chose importante...</li>
	<p>Attributed to Laurent Schwartz. I came across it reading <a href="http://www.hfleming.com/green.pdf" target="_blank">these</a> notes on Green's functions written by <a href="http://www.hfleming.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Henrique Fleming</a>. Legend tells Schwartz enjoyed catching butterflies and, when he was in Rio de Janeiro, a reporter surprised with how much time he spent on this would have asked him whether the butterflies were as important as Mathematics. Schwartz's answer? ''The butterflies are the only important thing...''
</p>
	<li>I can't stay up that late.</li>
	<p>Attributed to Sidney Coleman, refusing to teach a 9 a.m. class. As quoted on his <a href='https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/11/sidney-coleman-dies-at-70/' target="_blank">obituary at The Harvard Gazette</a>.</p>
