# Et cetera

This is the rest. Things I wanted to keep on this website but didn't really fit in other tabs. Here you can find some quotations I like, links to websites I like, et cetera.

## Quotations

My [old website](http://fma.if.usp.br/~nickolas/) already had a space for quotations in its Et cetera tab, but none of them had any sources. This time I'm gonna try to be more rigorous with these references, despite liking many quotations that are probably apocryphal.

<div style="text-align: justify">
   <ul>
		<li>''Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.''
		</li>
    <p>Silvanus P. Thompson, in <em>Calculus Made Easy: Being a very-simplest introduction to those beautiful methods of reckoning which are generally called by the terrifying names of the Differential Calculus and the Integral Calculus</em> (Macmillan, London, 1914).

## Questionable Quotations

Who am I fooling? Apocryphal quotations can be fun as well. Just be aware that I have no clue whether any of these were actually said. 


<div style="text-align: justify">
   <ul>
	<li>''Les papillons sont le seule chose importante...''</li>
	<p>Attributed to Laurent Schwartz. I came across it reading <a href="http://www.hfleming.com/green.pdf" target="_blank">these</a> notes on Green's functions written by <a href="http://www.hfleming.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Henrique Fleming</a>. Legend tells Schwartz enjoyed catching butterflies and, when he was in Rio de Janeiro, a reporter surprised with how much time he spent on this would have asked him whether the butterflies were as important as Mathematics. Schwartz answer? ''The butterflies are the only important thing...''

Here are a few links that the readers of this website might find interesting.

<div style="text-align: justify">
   <ul>
	   <li><a href="http://www.hfleming.com" target="_blank">Prof. Henrique Fleming's website</a> has excellent notes (mostly in Portuguese) concerning Physics and Mathematics which helped me numerous times.</li>
	   <li>You can find amazing materials on Mathematical Physics at <a href="http://denebola.if.usp.br/" target="_blank">Prof. João C. A. Barata's website</a>. In particular, the comprehensive online book <em><a href="http://denebola.if.usp.br/~jbarata/Notas_de_aula/notas_de_aula.html" target="_blank">Notas para um Curso de Física-Matemática</a></em>.</li>
	   <li>Ever wondered how can one study the whole Universe at once, or use gravitational waves to hear the Big Bang? Check out my friend <a href="http://fma.if.usp.br/~beatucci/" target="_blank">Beatriz Tucci's website</a> to learn more about GWs and Cosmology!</li>
