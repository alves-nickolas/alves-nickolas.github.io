Hello, there! I am Níckolas Alves, a Physics MSc student at the [Federal University of ABC](http://fisica.ufabc.edu.br/). This is my personal website. In here you will find a number of informations and documents concerning what I studied over the throughout my carreer in Physics, since my early days as an undergraduate student at the [Institute of Physics at the University of São Paulo](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/) (IFUSP), and also some links throwing you around to the webpages for events I organized (usually in Portuguese), links I find interesting, webpages from researchers I admire, and so on. A great deal of this website is based on my [old page](http://fma.if.usp.br/~nickolas/) hosted at IFUSP's [Department of Mathematical Physics](http://portal.if.usp.br/fma/).
