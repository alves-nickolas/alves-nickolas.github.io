Hello, there! I am Níckolas de Aguiar Alves, a theoretical physicist. I just got my MSc degree at the [Federal University of ABC](http://fisica.ufabc.edu.br/). I work in the interface between Quantum Mechanics and Gravitation. More specifically, I have recently been studying how to use the functional renormalization group to understand nonperturbative phenomena within quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

This is my personal website. Here you will find a number of pieces of information and documents concerning what I studied throughout my career in Physics, since my early days as an undergraduate student at the [Institute of Physics at the University of São Paulo](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/) (IFUSP), and also some links throwing you around to the webpages for events I organized (usually in Portuguese), links I find interesting, webpages from researchers I admire, and so on. A great deal of this website is based on my old page that used to be hosted at IFUSP's [Department of Mathematical Physics](http://portal.if.usp.br/fma/) (DFMA-IFUSP).
