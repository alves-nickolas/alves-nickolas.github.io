Hello, there! I am Níckolas de Aguiar Alves, a theoretical physicist currently pursuing my MSc degree at the [Federal University of ABC](http://fisica.ufabc.edu.br/). I work in the interface between Quantum Mechanics and Gravitation. More specifically, I am currently studying how to use the Functional Renormalization Group to understand nonperturbative phenomena within Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes.

This is my personal website. In here you will find a number of informations and documents concerning what I studied throughout my carreer in Physics, since my early days as an undergraduate student at the [Institute of Physics at the University of São Paulo](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/) (IFUSP), and also some links throwing you around to the webpages for events I organized (usually in Portuguese), links I find interesting, webpages from researchers I admire, and so on. A great deal of this website is based on my old page that used to be hosted at IFUSP's [Department of Mathematical Physics](http://portal.if.usp.br/fma/) (DFMA-IFUSP).
