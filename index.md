Hello, there! I am Níckolas de Aguiar Alves (he/him), a theoretical physicist. I am a PhD student at the [Federal University of ABC](http://fisica.ufabc.edu.br/). I work in the interface between quantum mechanics and gravitation. My interests are focused on general relativity, quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and general aspects of quantum gravity.

This is my website. Here you can find out a bit about my research, many notes I wrote while studying throughout the years, information about events I organized, links I find interesting, webpages from researchers I admire, and so on.
