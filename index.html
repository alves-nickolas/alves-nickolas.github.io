<p>Hello, there! I am Níckolas de Aguiar Alves (he/him), a theoretical physicist. I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://fisica.ufabc.edu.br/">Federal University of ABC</a>. I work in the interface between quantum mechanics and gravitation. My interests are focused on general relativity, quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and general aspects of quantum gravity.</p>

<p>This is my website. Here you can find out a bit about my research, many notes I wrote while studying throughout the years, information about events I organized, links I find interesting, webpages from researchers I admire, and so on.</p>
