## Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime

One of the biggest open problems in Physics is the quest to obtain a quantum theory of gravity. Since the 1930's it was know that General Relativity—our best description of spacetime—and Quantum Mechanics—our best description of what the Universe's fundamental laws should look like—seem to have weird behaviors when considered together. Since then, physicists have been working trying to figure out how to fit gravity and quantum phenomena together in the same picture and at all energies.

In the late 1960's and early 1970's, a particularly interesting line of research was born: the idea of considering a classical gravitational field alongside quantum mechanical fields. In this approach, known as Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime (QFTCS), one might still not be able to unravel all of the secrets behind full Quantum Gravity, but it is possible to obtain a better understanding of how gravity and quantum phenomena interact. For example, this approach has taught us that black holes can evaporate, particles can be created by strong fields, and much more. 

My particular interests in QFTCS lie mainly on foundational aspects. I belive an important task to be pursued is to understand what a quantum field theory _is_.
