# Research

Here you can find a bit more about my research interests and projects. This includes both themes I've actually worked or have been working on and some themes that draw my attention. 

This page is in construction, and hence things might still be a bit messy around here. 

## Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime

One of the biggest open problems in Physics is the quest to obtain a quantum theory of gravity. Since the 1930's it was know that General Relativity—our best description of spacetime—and Quantum Mechanics—our best description of what the Universe's fundamental laws should look like—seem to have weird behaviors when considered together. Since then, physicists have been working trying to figure out how to fit gravity and quantum phenomena together in the same picture and at all energies.

In the late 1960's and early 1970's, a particularly interesting line of research was born: the idea of considering a classical gravitational field alongside quantum mechanical fields. In this approach, known as Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime (QFTCS), one might still not be able to unravel all of the secrets behind full Quantum Gravity, but it is possible to obtain a better understanding of how gravity and quantum phenomena interact. For example, this approach has taught us that black holes can evaporate, particles can be created by strong fields, and much more. 

Much of my interest in QFTCS lie mainly on foundational aspects. I belive an important task to be pursued is to understand what a quantum field theory _is_, especially on a non-perturbative level. I believe investigating our current understanding of the world in a deeper mathemtical level might help us understand what lies beneath it. 

## Functional Renormalization Group

"Renormalization group" is a fancy name we give to understanding how theories change with scale. Theories in larger scales don't need to be treated with all of the details found in smaller scales. For example, when describing the motion of the ocean, it is usually unnecessary to take into account the molecular structure of water. The renormalization group helps us to do this "zoom out" procedure within the framework of quantum field theories. 

"Functional renormalization group" is the name given to some nonperturbative incarnations of the renormalization group. It then consists of a technique to obtain information about a theory that goes beyond the typical approximations done in physics. 

My main interest in the FRG is concerned with its applications to QFTCS problems, although I am also curious about its applications to quantum gravity by means of the asymptotic safety program.
