title: Negative Masses are Unstable
subtitle: and we don't need energy conditions to prove it
date: 2024-09-23
abstract: "We studied negative-mass, spherically symmetric stars made of ideal barotropic fluids. After considering linear perturbations away from staticity, we learned that all such models are unstable. Thus, we found a completely classical explanation for the absence of negative masses. While all previous positive mass theorems assume microscopic positivity of mass in some sense, ours does not."
