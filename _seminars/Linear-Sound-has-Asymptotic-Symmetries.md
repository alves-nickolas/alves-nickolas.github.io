title: Linear sound has asymptotic symmetries
subtitle: and a whole infrared triangle
date: 2025-12-08
abstract: "General relativity, electrodynamics, and many other relativistic theories display memory effects. This is a general property of the wave equation itself. In particular, acoustics admits a memory effect. By writing sound in terms of a dual two-form field, we showed how this memory effect can be connected to asymptotic symmetries and a soft theorem."
