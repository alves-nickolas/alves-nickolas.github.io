title: Nonperturbative Renormalization Group Flow for a Particle Detector
date: 2023-12-04
abstract: "The functional renormalization group is a powerful tool to study nonperturbative physics, but it has not been much explored within quantum field theory in curved spacetime yet. On the other hand, particle detectors are an omnipresent tool within quantum field theory in curved spacetime and relativistic quantum information but are often treated only perturbatively. In this paper, we present the first computation of the functional renormalization group flow for a particle detector. The chosen model is an inertial Unruh–DeWitt detector in Minkowski spacetime, for simplicity. A new development in heat kernel techniques—the Taylor trick—is necessary to perform the calculations and it is important to carefully choose cutoffs that diverge at the ultraviolet limit to keep the beta functions finite. We compare our results with the MS-bar results at one-loop and find that both computations agree qualitatively, as expected."
