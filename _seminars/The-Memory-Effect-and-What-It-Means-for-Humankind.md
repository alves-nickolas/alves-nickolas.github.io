title: The Memory Effect and What It Means for Humankind
subtitle: (or Don't Forget About Memory)
date: 2024-06-14
abstract: "The memory effect is a prediction in classical general relativity that consists of the fact that, upon the passage of a gravitational wave, a pair of nearby inertial detectors will be permanently displaced. In this seminar, I will review the basic ideas behind the linear memory effect and discuss how it is connected to other infrared aspects of general relativity, such as Weinberg’s soft graviton theorem and the Bondi–Metzner–Sachs group."
