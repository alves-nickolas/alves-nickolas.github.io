<p> Welcome to hic sunt dracones! I every now and then write threads on my <a href="https://twitter.com/nickfismat" target="_blank">personal twitter</a> concerning Physics and Mathematics. Eventually I decided it was about time I created a blog to have a more logical way of doing SciComm. You see, I'm talkative, which means splitting texts in 280-character-long tweets frequently leads to dozens of tweets on a single thread. Hence, a blog. </p>
